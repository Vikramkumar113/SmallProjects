    <!-- In this tutorial we used a command for access all tailwind css and that command 
    command :- npx tailwindcss init vikramconf --full
   In vikramconf file there is all tailwindcss details but if you want to add more functionality you can edit tailwind.config.js file
    for example- In vikraconf file there is list of fontsize till 9xl but if you want to 10xl or any size that is not in the list you can create that size by yourself.

    Now question is How to edit
    Its simple go to tailwind.config.js file then in this file go to extend and add your 10xl size or whatever size you want 
    Example- 

      extend{
        fontsize: {
            '10xl': ['9rem', { lineHeight: '2' }],
        }
      }
